# DineTap – Digital Menu for Restaurants

TapDine is a simple digital menu platform for restaurants. It lets restaurants manage their menus online, and customers can view them instantly by scanning a QR code. It’s a fast and contactless way to browse food menus.
The project focuses on usability and efficiency, especially for small restaurants that need a digital presence without technical overhead. I built the front end and used Firebase for real-time data handling.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Firebase (Realtime Database, Hosting)

## ✨ Features
- 🏪 Restaurant registration and menu management system.
- 📷 QR code generation for each restaurant’s unique menu.
- 🔄 Real-time syncing using Firebase.
- 📱 Fully responsive layout for customers and admin use.
- 🧑‍💼 **Admin Dashboard** for restaurants to manage menu items easily.

## 👨‍🍳 Admin Dashboard

Each restaurant gets access to an intuitive admin panel where they can:

- Add, update, or remove food items (CRUD operations).
- Instantly update menu prices and descriptions.
- Monitor what the live menu looks like in real time.
- Generate and access a QR code linking directly to their public menu.

## 🧑‍🍳 How It Works

1. A restaurant registers on the platform and sets up its menu.
2. Each restaurant gets a unique QR code that links to its live menu.
3. Admins can update items anytime — changes appear instantly to customers.
4. Customers simply scan the QR to view the menu on their phones.

No refresh or delay — menu changes show up instantly for customers.
